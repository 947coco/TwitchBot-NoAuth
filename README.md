# Purpose
I didn't found a twitch bot that doesn't require twitch credential or twitch token. 
So i created a bot that can read message from a twitch chat without the need of any credential.
You will just need to indicate the name of the twitch channel you want the messages from.   
 

## Setup
Write the name of the twitch channel in the config.txt file and click on INSTALLER.bat
Other parameters are available in this file. 

### In the futur, i will :
Make a mode that will allowed an ai from the Ollama service to anwser to the message when the flag /AI will be invoked
Create commands to do smtg on your pc (like press a key or make a sound...)    
    
### Advancement
- [x] Connection to twitch tchat
- [x] Read and store data in config.txt
- [x] Artificial voice
- [x] Only 1 installation file 
- [ ] AI mode 
- [ ] Custom commands
